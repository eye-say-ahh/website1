    <h1>trails to the black mamba</h1>
    <p>kobe grew up watching his father play professional basketball in the NBA and overseas, his first nickname was kobe "bean" bryant, he took bean from his father that was passed down to him, when he was in highschool he was named the next MJ by himself, through his processes to the NBA kobe had been drafted by the charlotte hornets later was traded for vlade divac to the lakers. kobe began starting off the bench in which he had made an all star apperance and first went at MJ. Kobe was tearing up the nba off the bench for his first two years. then he got heavy minutes as he got older. kobe wasnt known as the black mamba till he and shaq had dominated the leauge for 3 years running failing to secure a 4th champioinship. kobe years without shaq were tough and finding any help were next to none, so he just tore up the league securing scoring titles, all star selections, all first team and defensive teams. during that time thats when kobe secured the black mamba name. it wasnt till 2008 when kobe got pau gasol and phil jackson back to coach, that year he kead his team to the finals and lost, but went back the next two years and won back to back. kobe then just tore up the league for another 4 years, battling injuries and early playoff exits to the likes to the mavricks who knocked them out first round of the 2011 playoffs and proceeded to win the title, that was the last time kobe ever played in the playoffs and the reign of the black mamba in the playoffs died.
